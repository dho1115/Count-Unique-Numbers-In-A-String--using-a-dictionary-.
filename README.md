Using a dictionary and the "power" of recursion, this app counts the number of unique numbers in a string.

NOTE that "power" is in quotes. Sometimes, I wonder if it's any faster than a for loop or with just using set( ) or even list comprehension.

But, that's just me. Oh, well.

Renamed file to recursion.py.
